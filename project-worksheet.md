Project Description: Full stack App. Designed to be a quiet site, linking roasts from all across the U.S to coffee lovers. Resulting in a nice place to reconnect to your home towns roaster, try something new. and for my drop-ship business to expand.
Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

Wireframes
Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

MVP/PostMVP - 5min
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

MVP EXAMPLE
Build a back end to send any data relevant for Roasters
Render data on page
Allow user to interact with the page
PostMVP EXAMPLE
Add localStorage or firebase for storage
Components
Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

Component	Description
App	This will ideally not do anything except for be the source for a useContext hook
Main    This will contain the router and render some of the roasters
RightNav This will have the links to roaster info, list of roasts, roast types
LeftNav This will have the links for roasters to sign in, roaster blogs, and a place order page
Header	This will render the link to the load page
Login	This will ideally provide an option for the Roaster to sign up and allow them to create 
Footer	This will render the nav which will link to our about us page, and a contact us page
Roasters This will render all of the roasters

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

Component	Priority	Estimated Time	Time Invetsted	Actual Time
Adding Form	H	3hrs	3.5hrs	3.5hrs
Working with API	H	3hrs	2.5hrs	2.5hrs
Total	H	6hrs	5hrs	5hrs
Additional Libraries
Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc.

Code Snippet
Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description. Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code.

function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
